## Functions
There are some built-in functions, yeah? Every language has those.

### print
Print is a handy dandy function that allows debugging to be easy.

To print text, you use this line of code.
```vb
print 'Hello world!'
```
Its a simple line. 'Hello world' can be anything!

### type
Type is a function that (currently) has 2 basic outputs. `<key>` and `<str>`

How to use it? Well, it's easy. Here are a couple of examples.
```vb
type 'a'
type |print
type |type
```
Why does it have those lines before `print` and `type`? Check the grammar files, idiot.

Just kidding. Those are ignore lines. They make it so the functions don't run.

That's all for now.
